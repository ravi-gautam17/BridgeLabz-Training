```
- Studied SOLID principles:
  - Single Responsibility (SRP)
  - Open/Closed (OCP)
  - Liskov Substitution (LSP)
  - Interface Segregation (ISP)
  - Dependency Inversion (DIP)
- Covered additional design principles:
  - DRY, KISS, YAGNI, Separation of Concerns
  - Programming to interfaces
  - Favor composition over inheritance
- Practiced Object Calisthenics rules for clean design:
  - One level of indentation
  - One dot per line
  - Small cohesive classes
- Studied GoF design patterns overview:
  - Creational, Structural, Behavioral categories
- Implemented core patterns:
  - Singleton
  - Factory
  - Observer
  - Builder
- Analyzed UML diagrams and real-world analogies for patterns.
- Solved pattern-based exercises and mini design problems.
- Committed and pushed all work.

### 🗓 Day 33 – Multithreading in Java  
**(Date: 02-Feb-2026)**
- Studied process vs thread concepts and multithreading benefits and drawbacks.
- Learned Java thread lifecycle:
  - `NEW`, `RUNNABLE`, BLOCKED`, `WAITING`, `TIMED_WAITING` & `TERMINATED`
- Created threads using:
  - Extending `Thread`
  - Implementing `Runnable`
- Practiced core `Thread` methods:
  - `start()`, `sleep()`, `join()`, `yield()`, `isAlive()`
- Worked with thread priorities, daemon threads, and interruption handling.
- Implemented synchronization for shared database resources.
- Compared single-threaded vs multi-threaded payroll insertion performance.
- Solved use cases involving:
  - Parallel employee inserts
  - Salary updates using threads
  - DB consistency checks with JUnit
- Logged execution timing and validated results using test cases.
- Committed and pushed all work.
